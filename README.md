## __Detials About This Assignment__
The purpose of this homework assignment was to gain a better understanding utilizing Bootstap frameworks within Semantic HTML to build a site, and customizing that work with our own CSS design. We had to make our custom css styles be responsive along with the rest of the site. I tried to use the minimum about of Media Queries, instead taking advantage of the cdn bootstap provides.
